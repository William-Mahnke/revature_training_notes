-- GROUP BY : allows FOR the RESULT SET TO GROUP the VALUES based ON a COLUMN that IS specified

-- HAVING : a secondary aggregation/filter of data based on the grouping of information that is specifed earlier in the query

 * The AS keyword is optional in PostgreSQL — the alias can be written
 * directly after the column or table name — however AS is recommended
 * for clarity and readability.

 * 
 * Casing for the letters supplied in the sequence you wish to match matters
 * Note that wildcards match either casing.
 * 
 * When performing a LIKE operation, it is traditional to use a Scalar function
 * to convert the resultset values to a particular casing
