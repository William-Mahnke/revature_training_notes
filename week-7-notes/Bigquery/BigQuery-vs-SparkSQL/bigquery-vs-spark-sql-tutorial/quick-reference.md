# BigQuery vs Spark SQL — Quick Decision Guide

## Choose BigQuery when

- Interactive SQL analytics and BI are the main workload.
- You want managed compute and storage without Spark cluster administration.
- Data is already in BigQuery.
- Workloads are SQL-first ELT, dashboards, reporting, or ad-hoc analysis.
- High analyst concurrency and centralized governance matter.

## Choose Spark SQL when

- Transformations require custom Python, Scala, Java, or R logic.
- You process large data-lake files and open formats.
- Advanced stateful streaming is needed.
- The workload must be portable across environments.
- You require low-level control over partitions, memory, caching, shuffles, and executors.

## Use both when

Spark performs complex ingestion, data quality, enrichment, sessionization, or feature engineering, and BigQuery stores curated data for SQL analytics and BI.

## Core distinction

BigQuery is a managed analytical data platform. Spark SQL is a programmable distributed processing engine.
