## Real-World Story

Imagine an international e-commerce company.

Customers\
↓\
Website\
↓\
Orders Generated

Many systems need the order:

- Inventory
- Payment
- Shipping
- Email Notification
- Analytics
- Fraud Detection

The challenge is:

How can one order be sent to many systems simultaneously?

This is where **Messaging Systems** come in.

Two popular solutions are:

1. Apache Kafka
2. Google Cloud Pub/Sub

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is an **open-source distributed event streaming platform**.

Applications write events into Kafka Topics, and consumers read them
independently.

Common use cases:

- High-speed streaming
- Event-driven architectures
- Log aggregation
- Data pipelines
- Real-time analytics

``` text
Producer
   |
   v
+--------------+
| Kafka Topic  |
+--------------+
| Partition 1  |
| Partition 2  |
| Partition 3  |
+--------------+
  |    |    |
  v    v    v
Consumer A
Consumer B
Consumer C
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Google Cloud Pub/Sub?

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is Google's **fully managed messaging service**.

You only create Topics and Subscriptions. Google manages:

- Infrastructure
- Scaling
- Replication
- High Availability
- Maintenance

``` text
Publisher
    |
    v
+----------+
|  Topic   |
+----------+
 |   |   |
 v   v   v
Sub1 Sub2 Sub3
 |     |     |
SvcA SvcB  SvcC
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Messaging Systems?

Without messaging:

``` text
Order Service
   |
---------------------------------
|  |   |    |      |
Inv Pay Ship Mail Analytics
```

Problems:

- Tight coupling
- Slow downstream systems affect upstream systems
- Difficult to add new consumers

With messaging:

``` text
Order Service
      |
      v
 Messaging Platform
      |
-----------------------------
|   |    |    |      |
Inv Ship Mail Fraud Analytics
```

Each consumer works independently.

## Kafka vs Pub/Sub Overview

| Kafka | Google Cloud Pub/Sub |
| --- | --- |
| Open Source | Fully Managed |
| Install & Manage Yourself | No Installation |
| Stores Events | Delivers Events |
| Full Infrastructure Control | Google Manages Infrastructure |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deployment

### Kafka Deployment

You manage:

- Brokers
- Storage
- Replication
- Upgrades
- Monitoring
- Scaling

### Pub/Sub Deployment

Google manages everything.

You simply:

1. Create Topic
2. Create Subscription
3. Publish
4. Consume

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Message Storage

### Kafka Message Storage

- Long configurable retention
- Replay historical events
- Consumers control offsets

### Pub/Sub Message Storage

- Configurable retention for reliable delivery
- Supports replay within retention window
- Optimized for message delivery

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ordering

### Kafka Ordering

Ordering guaranteed within a partition.

### Pub/Sub Ordering

Ordering supported using Ordering Keys.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scalability

### Kafka Scalability

Manual cluster expansion.

### Pub/Sub Scalability

Automatic scaling handled by Google.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Security

### Kafka Security

Configure manually:

- SSL
- SASL
- ACLs

### Pub/Sub Security

Integrated with:

- IAM
- Service Accounts
- Cloud Audit Logs
- Encryption

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Monitoring

Kafka:

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- JMX

Pub/Sub:

- Cloud Monitoring
- Cloud Logging
- Cloud Audit Logs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Real-World Example

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When to Choose Kafka

Choose Kafka if:

- Need event replay
- Multi-cloud
- On-premises
- High throughput streaming
- Long-term retention
- Fine-grained control

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When to Choose Pub/Sub

Choose Pub/Sub if:

- Working mainly in GCP
- Want serverless architecture
- Need automatic scaling
- Prefer no infrastructure management
- Integrating with Dataflow or BigQuery

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Kafka | Pub/Sub |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Event Streaming Platform | Managed Messaging |
| Installation | Required | None |
| Scaling | Manual | Automatic |
| Replay | Excellent | Within retention window |
| Ordering | Per Partition | Ordering Keys |
| Infrastructure | Self Managed | Google Managed |
| Best For | Streaming Platforms | Cloud Native Apps |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Flow

``` text
Need infrastructure control?
        |
      Yes ---> Kafka
        |
       No
        |
Using GCP?
        |
      Yes ---> Pub/Sub
        |
       No
        |
Need long-term replay?
        |
      Yes ---> Kafka
        |
       No ---> Pub/Sub
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advantages

### Kafka Advantages

- Open source
- Vendor independent
- Excellent replay
- High throughput
- Large ecosystem

### Pub/Sub Advantages

- Fully managed
- Auto scaling
- Easy integration
- High availability
- Minimal operations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limitations

### Kafka Limitations

- Operational complexity
- Cluster management
- Capacity planning

### Pub/Sub Limitations

- GCP ecosystem dependency
- Less infrastructure control

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interview Questions

### Which requires brokers?

Kafka.

### Which requires installation?

Kafka.

### Which is easier to manage?

Pub/Sub.

### Which integrates best with Dataflow?

Pub/Sub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

| Choose Kafka | Choose Pub/Sub |

| Event Streaming | Managed Messaging |
| Replay | Easy Operations |
| Multi-cloud | GCP Native |
| Infrastructure Control | Automatic Scaling |

## Key Takeaway

**Kafka** is best when you need a durable event streaming platform with
replay and infrastructure control.

**Google Cloud Pub/Sub** is best when you want a fully managed, scalable
messaging service tightly integrated with Google Cloud.
